                    <p>
                        The SIDH are a young and energetic band, always looking for new ideas and musical
                        arrangements,
                        without forgetting their roots. Original and innovative, The result is a combination of
                        highly
                        contemporary and modern Celtic music, made of Whistles and Bagpipes, Keyboards and
                        Percussions,
                        Hip
                        Hop and Breton beats, able to recreate, according to Hevia, atmospheres with a distinctive
                        scent
                        of
                        “future tradition”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite their young age, the SIDH can boast of collaborations with internationally renown
                        artists
                        such as Carlos Nuñez, Hevia, Paddy Moloney (Chieftains), Lindsey Stirling, Flook, Barrage,
                        Athy,

                    <div class="about_text">
                        <h2>PERSONAL/ PROFESSIONAL HISTORY</h2>
                        <p>The Sidh was actually formed in Italy in 2010 by Iain Alexander Marr (Whistles / Bagpipe) and
                            Federico Melato – (Keyboard / Piano / Synth / Percussions). Then in 2011, they added
                            Salvatore
                            Pagliaro (Guitars) and Michael Subet – (Electric Bass).
                        </p>
                        <p>This might seem odd, considering they are playing instruments and using base notes
                            traditional to
                            the Irish Celtic music I’ve come to love. But what they do, they do it well. They are not
                            actually claiming to be traditional at all, they are actually quite eclectic.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 2012, Lindsey Stirling welcomed the band on stage for a performance of “The Legend of
                            Sidh.”
                            This was a major welcome for them to a larger concert. They went on from there to work with
                            several Irish dance companies in turn.
                        </p>
                        <p>They released Follow the Flow not long after.</p>
                        <p>For years they’ve been performing at Celtic Festivals all over Europe and putting out videos
                            and
                            songs as they came. Here is one example from Montelago Celtic Festival in 2014 –
                        </p>
                        <p>Their Album, Nitro was released in 2014 as well.</p>
                        <p>After opening for Lindsey Stirling in 2015, the band released their hit “Iridium” and began
                            touring again.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 2018 they released Another Way To Fly. Another Way To Fly has more of a pop-acoustic feel
                            to
                            it than previous albums.
                        </p>
                        <p>Making it through the pandemic, the band came out on the other side and has released the
                            single
                            “Utopia” which is off of their new album Nigredo. I don’t see any tour dates listed, and
                            thanks
                            to the global pandemic, not sure when they will.

                        <h2>STYLE AND INFLUENCE</h2>
                        <p>Iain is half Scottish and half Italian and the founder of the band. He tends to manage and
                            promotional efforts. Federico doesn’t just play his instruments and mix, he also helps with
                            arrangement and composition. Salvatore is responsible for the “metal” of the band,
                            songwriting,
                            and merchandising. Michael is the natural showman and kind of choreographs the show.
                        </p>
                        <p>People out in the world tend to forget that Italy was invaded and inhabited by the Celts for
                            hundreds of years. They did leave a lasting impact. Some Italians are discovering that they
                            have
                            a Celtic origin in their family. The music in Northern Italy is actually heavily influenced.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to Valkyries Webzine, in a 2018 interview, Iain grew up half Scottish and so was
                            naturally drawn to such things. Federico and his family were enthusiasts who loved going to
                            Celtic festivals learning percussions and reenactment. And Salvatore actually learned to
                            pipe in
                            another band before joining The Sidh.
                        </p>
                        <p>The band describes themselves as such:</p>
                        <p><cite>With dozens of international Tours around the world, sharing the stage with the
                                greatest
                                exponents of the folk scene and many television appearances, The SIDH brings on stage an
                                impressive burst of energy with their Electro / Celtic Music, made with Dubstep Rhythms
                                and
                                Bagpipes, EDM rhythms and Whistles. The Millions of views on Youtube and the Millions of
                                listening on Spotify are making The SIDH one of the most clicked Celtic Bands.

                            </cite>
                        </p>
                        <p>On YouTube the band only posted a few times in 2019 leading up to the pandemic, mostly live
                            performances and also two full shows from 2019 – The Sidh Audio Boosted Montelago is one of
                            those.
                        </p>
                        <p>Then, in the middle of the pandemic, they created “I Can’t Let Go” with Tim Chaisson, music
                            created from two different countries. It’s a beautiful piece.
                        </p>
                        <p>Suddenly we have a teaser trailer for “Utopia” hitting in July. It’s just one song from the
                            band’s latest album, Nigredo. “Utopia” is a masterful work, even more exciting than
                            “Iridium”,
                            which had been my favorite. Check the video release out…

                        <p>They’ve collaborated on stage with Lindsey Stirling and even opened for her in 2015.</p>
                        <p>In 2019, the band worked on a song that blended Khoomei (throat singing) with their own
                            unique
                            style – Khan ft. Marcin Ruminski, a multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, and vocalist
                            that
                            specializes in folk music from all over the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>More recently, during the pandemic, they collaborated on a song with Tim Chaisson that I
                            mention
                            below. But these aren’t the only collaborations they’ve popped into!
